    <title>The Song of the Feet</title>

  <body>
    <p>It is appropriate that I sing The song of the feet</p>
    <p>The weight of the body And what the body chooses to bear</p>  
    <p>Fall on me I trampled the American wilderness</p>
      <p>Forged frontier walls Outran the mob in Tulsa</p>
      <p>Got caught in Philadelphia And am still unreparated</p>
      <p>I solidered on in Korea Jungled through Vietnam sweated out Desert Storm</p>
      <p>Caved my way through Afghanistan Tunnled the World Trade Center</p>
      <p>And on the worst day of my life Walked behind JFK</p>
      <p>Shouldered MLk Stood embracing Sister Betty</p>
      <p>I wiggle my toes In the sand of time</p>
      <p>Trusting the touch that controls my motion Basking in the warmth of the embrace</p>
      <p>Day's end offers with warm salty water It is appropriate I sing</p>
      <p>The praise of the feet</p>
      <br>
      <p>I</p>
      <p>am</p>
      <p>a</p>
      <p>Black</p>
      <p>woman</p>
