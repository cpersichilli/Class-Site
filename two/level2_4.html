    <h1>I am a Black woman</h1>
    <p>It is appropriate that I sing
        <br>
The song of the feet
        <br>
<br> 
The weight of the body
        <br>
And what the body chooses to bear
        <br>
Fall on me
        <br>
        <br>
 
I trampled the American wilderness
Forged frontier trails
Outran the mob in Tulsa
Got caught in Philadelphia
 <br>
 <br>
And am still unreparated
 <br>
<br>        
I soldiered on in Korea
        <br>
Jungled through Vietman sweated out Desert Storm
        <br>
Caved my way through Afghanistan
        <br>
Tunneled the World Trade Center
 <br>
 <br>
And on the worst day of my life
        <br>
Walked behind JFK
        <br>
Shouldered MLK
        <br>
Stood embracing Sister Betty
        <br>
 <br>
 
I wiggle my toes
        <br>
In the sands of time
        <br>
Trusting the touch that controls my motion
        <br>
Basking in the warmth of the embrace
        <br>
Dayâ€™s end offers with warm salty water
 <br>
 <br>
It is appropriate I sing
        <br>
The praise of the feet</p>
