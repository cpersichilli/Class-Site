    <h1>It is appropriate that I sing
      <br>
      The song of the feet</h1>
      <h2>The weight of the body
      <br>
      And what the body chooses to bear
      <br>
      Fall on me</h2>
      <h3>I trampled the American wilderness
      <br>
      Forged frontier trails
      <br>
      Outran the mob in Tulsa
      <br>
      Got caught in Philadelphia
      <br>
      <br>
      And am still unreparated</h3>
      <h4>I soldiered on in Korea
        <br>
Jungled through Vietman sweated out Desert Storm
        <br>
Caved my way through Afghanistan
        <br>
Tunneled the World Trade Center</h4>
      <h5>And on the worst day of my life
        <br>
Walked behind JFK
        <br>
Shouldered MLK
        <br>
Stood embracing Sister Betty</h5>
      <h6>I wiggle my toes
        <br>
In the sands of time
        <br>
Trusting the touch that controls my motion
        <br>
Basking in the warmth of the embrace
        <br>
Dayâ€™s end offers with warm salty water</h6>
    <p>It is appropriate I sing
        <br>
The praise of the feet</p>
