    The Song of the Feet by Nikki Giovanni  
    </div>  
      
    <div class="one">
        It is appropriate that I sing The song of the feet
    </div>
    
    <div class="two">
        The weight of the body And what the body chooses to bear Fall on me
    </div>  
      
    <div class="three">
        I trampled the American wilderness Forged frontier trails Outran the mob in Tulsa Got caught in Philadelphia
    </div>
      
    <div class="four">
        And am still unreparated
    </div>
      
    <div class="five">
        I soldiered on in Korea Jungled through Vietman sweated out Desert Storm Caved my way through Afghanistan Tunneled the World Trade Center
    </div>
      
    <div class="six">
        And on the worst day of my life Walked behind JFK Shouldered MLK Stood embracing Sister Betty
    </div>
      
    <div class="seven">
        I wiggle my toes In the sands of time Trusting the touch that controls my motion Basking in the warmth of the embrace Dayâ€™s end offers with warm salty water
    </div>
      
    <div class="eight">
        It is appropriate I sing The praise of the feet
    </div>
      
    <div class="nine">
        I am a Black woman
    </div>
