<div class="one">
It is appropriate that I sing
    <br>
The song of the feet
</div>
<div class="two">
The weight of the body
    <br>
And what the body chooses to bear
    <br>
Fall on me
    <br>
    <br>
I trampled the American wilderness
    <br>
Forged frontier trails
    <br>
Outran the mob in Tulsa
    <br>
Got caught in Philadelphia  
    <br>
    <br>
And am still unreparated
    <br>
    <br>
I soldiered on in Korea
    <br>
Jungled through Vietman sweated out Desert Storm
    <br>
Caved my way through Afghanistan
    <br>
Tunneled the World Trade Center
    <br>
    <br>
And on the worst day of my life
    <br>
Walked behind JFK
    <br>
Shouldered MLK
    <br>
Stood embracing Sister Betty
    <br>
    <br>
I wiggle my toes
    <br>
In the sands of time
    <br>
Trusting the touch that controls my motion
    <br>
Basking in the warmth of the embrace
    <br>
Dayâ€™s end offers with warm salty water
    <br>
    <br>
</div>
<div class="three">
It is appropriate I sing
    <br>
The praise of the feet
</div>
