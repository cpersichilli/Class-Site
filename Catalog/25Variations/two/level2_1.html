      <h3>It is appropriate that I sing</h3>
    <h2>The song of the feet</h2>
    <p>The <strong>weight</strong> of the body
      <br>
      And what the body <em>chooses</em> to bear
      <br>
      Fall on me</p>
    <p>I trampled the American Wilderness
      <br>
      Forged frontier trails
      <br>
      Outran the mob in Tulsa
      <br>Got caught in Philadelphia</p>
      <p>And am <em>still</em> unreparated</p>
      <p>I solidered in Korea
      <br>
      Jungled through Vietnam sweated out Desert Storm
      <br>
      Caved my way through Afghanistan
      <br>
      Tunneled the <strong>World Trade Center</strong></p>
      <p>And on the <em>worst</em> day of my life
      <br>
      Walked behind JFK
      <br>
      Shouldered MLK
      <br>
      Stood embracing Sister Betty</p>
      <p>I <em>wiggle</em> my toes
      <br> 
      In the sands of time
      <br>
      Trusting the touch that controls my motion
      <br>
      Basking in the warmth of the embrace
      <br>Day's end offers with warm salty water</p>
      <h3>It is appropriate I sing</h3>
      <h4>The praise of the feet</h4>
