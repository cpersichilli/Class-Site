        The Song of the Feet
        <br>
        <br>
        by Nikki Giovanni
    </div>  
    <div class="two">
        It is appropriate that I sing
        <br>
        The song of the feet
    </div>
    <div class="three">
        The weight of the body
        <br>
        And what the body chooses to bear
        <br>
        Fall on me
    </div>
    <div class="four">
        I trampled the American Wilderness
        <br>
        Forged frontier trails
        <br>
        Outran the mob in Tulsa
        <br>
        Got caught in Philadelphia
    </div>  
    <div class="five">
    An am still unreparated  
    </div>  
    <div class="six">
        I soldiered on in Korea
        <br>
        Jungled through Vietnam sweated out Desert Storm
        <br>
        Caved my way through Afghanistan
        <br>
        Tunneled the World Trade Center
    </div>  
    <div class="seven">
        And on the worst day of my life
        <br>
        Walked behind JFK
        <br>
        Shouldered MLK
        <br>
        Stood embracing Sister Betty
    </div>  
    <div class="eight">
        I wiggle my toes
        <br>
        In the sands of time
        <br>
        Trusting the touch that controls my motion
        <br>
        Basking in the warmth of the embrace
        <br>
        Day's end offers warm salty water
    </div>
    <div class="nine">
        It is appropriate I sing
        <br>
        The praise of the feet
    </div> 
    <div class="ten">
        I am a Black woman
    </div>
