      <p>The Song of the Feet by Nikki Giovanni</p>
      <p>It is appropriate that I sing
      The song of the feet</p>
      <p>The weight of the body
      And what the body chooses to bear
      Fall on me</p>
      <p>I trampled the American wilderness
      Forged frontier trails
      Outran the mob in Tulsa
      Got caught in Philadelphia</p>
      <p>And am still unreparted</p>
      <p>I soldiered on in Korea
      Jungled through Vietnam sweated out Desert Storm
      Caved my way through Afghanistan
      Tuneled the World Trade Center</p>
      <p>And on the worst day of my life
      Walked behind JFK
      Shouldered MLK
      Stood embracing Sister Berry</p>
      <p>I wiggle my toes
      In the sands of time
      Trusting the touch that controls my motion
      Basking in the warmth of the embrace
      Day's end offers with warm salty water</p>
      <p>It is appropriate I sing
      The praise of the feet</p>
      <p>I am a black woman</p>
