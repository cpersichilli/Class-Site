        <h5>By Nikki Giovanni</h5>
        <p>
            It is appropriate that I sing
            <br>
            The song of the feet
            <br>
            <br>
            The weight of the body
            <br>
            And what the body chooses to bear
            <br>
            Fall on me
            <br>
            <br>
            I trampled the American wilderness
            <br>
            Forged frontier trails
            <br>
            Outran the mob in Tulsa
            <br>
            Got caught in Philadelphia
            <br>
            <br>
            And am still unreparated
            <br>
            <br>
            I soldiered on in Korea
            <br>
            Jungled through Vietman sweated out Desert Storm
            <br>
            Caved my way through Afghanistan
            <br>
            Tunneled the World Trade Center
            <br>
            <br>
            And on the worst day of my life
            <br>
            Walked behind JFK
            <br>
            Shouldered MLK
            <br>
            Stood embracing Sister Betty
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            I wiggle my toes
            <br>
            In the sands of time
            <br>
            Trusting the touch that controls my motion
            <br>
            Basking in the warmth of the embrace
            <br>
            Day’s end offers with warm salty water
            <br>
            <br>
            It is appropriate I sing
            <br>
            The praise of the feet
            <br>
            <br>
