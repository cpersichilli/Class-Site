        It is appropriate that I sing
        <br>
        The song of the feet   
      </div>
      <div class="three">
        The weight of the body
        <br>
        And what the body chooses to bear
        <br>
        Fall on me
      </div>
      <div class="four">
        I trampled the American wilderness
          <br>
        Forged frontier trails
          <br>
        Outran the mob in Tulsa
          <br>
        Got caught in Philadelphia  
      </div>
      <div class="five">
        And am still unreparated

      <div class="six">
        I soldiered on in Korea
          <br>
        Jungled through Vietman sweated out Desert Storm
          <br>
        Caved my way through Afghanistan
          <br>
        Tunneled the World Trade Center
      </div>
      <div class="seven">
        And on the worst day of my life
          <br>
        Walked behind JFK
          <br>
        Shouldered MLK
          <br>
        Stood embracing Sister Betty
      </div>
      <div class="eight">
        I wiggle my toes
          <br>
        In the sands of time
          <br>
        Trusting the touch that controls my motion
          <br>
        Basking in the warmth of the embrace
          <br>
        Dayâ€™s end offers with warm salty water
      </div>
      <div class="nine">
        It is appropriate I sing
          <br>
        The praise of the feet
