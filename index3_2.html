     It is appropriate that I sing
        <br>
     The song of the feet

    <div class="two">
    The weight of the body

    Fall on me

    I trampled the American wilderness
        <br>
    Forged frontier trails
        <br>
    Outran the mob in Tulsa
        <br>
    Got caught in Philadelphia

    <div class="four">
    And am still unreparated

    I soldiered on in Korea
        <br>
    Jungled through Vietman sweated out Desert Storm
        <br>
    Caved my way through Afghanistan
        <br>
    Tunneled the World Trade Center
    </div>      
    <div class="six">
    And on the worst day of my life
        <br>
    Walked behind JFK
        <br>
    Shouldered MLK
        <br>
    Stood embracing Sister Betty  
    </div>  
    <div class="seven">
    I wiggle my toes
        <br>
    In the sands of time
        <br>
    Trusting the touch that controls my motion
        <br>
    Basking in the warmth of the embrace
        <br>
    Dayâ€™s end offers with warm salty water
    </div>

     It is appropriate that I sing
